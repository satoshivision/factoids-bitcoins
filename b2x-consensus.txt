Some `shills can spread `FUD
that
everyone in Bitcoin wanted to
increase block size x2
even if it would mean core developers leaving.

In reality, `b2x 
tried that,
and reached only 15% of economical support
(futures).

This trumps miners (80% hashrate) and CEOs (with millions of customers),
because Bitcoin is decentralized,
money talks
bullshit walks.
