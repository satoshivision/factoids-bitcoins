Bcash (BCH, a.k.a "Bitcoin-Cash", do NOT confuse with the `Bitcoin)
is an altcoin
(or rather `forkcoin)
that was created as hardfork

that rejected Bitcoin update of `segwit

and also changed difficulty formula to keep mining on same PoW.

Many of it's supporters are loudly spreading `FUD about Bitcoin,
lead by Roger Ver.
