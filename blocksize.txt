Bitcoin max blocksize was increased in 2017.08 to 1.7 MB.

Increasing block size forever to "scale" is bad idea:
eventually everyone would run `spv wallet instead `fullnode
since it's comfortable (`bigblocks-nodes).

This gives up on money that everyone can verify (`satoshivision)

and is very insecure (`spv).
