Bitcoin max blocksize was increased in 2017.08 to 1.7 MB.

Increasing block size forever to "scale" is bad idea:
demand for blocks is unbound (micro-transactions), 8, 32, 1000 MB
so
eventually everyone would run `spv
wallet
as
`fullnode will become too hard (network, cpu cost).

This gives up on money that everyone can verify (`satoshivision)
and is very insecure (`spv).
