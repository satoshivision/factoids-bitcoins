Call to authority is
a fallacy
of stating that because "respected person" said something it must be true.

It is incorrect since:

the conditions could have changed over years,
person could be mistaken,

Chence acquisition of the @bitcoin twitter, blockexplorer.com, bitcoin.com
by `shills of bcash.

Truthful statement can be logically explained on own merit.
