Call to authority is
a fallacy
where one can not defend his arguments
in any logical way
other then by saying that some respected person said it too.

This is not always true implication, because:
the person can be quoted out of context (see `whitepaper),
the conditions could have changed over years (again `whitepaper),
person could be mistaken in given instance,
and anyway a truthful statement can be logically explained
using other facts.

It's often used by `bcash shills to spread `FUD.
