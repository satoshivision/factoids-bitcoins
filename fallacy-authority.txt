Call to authority is
a fallacy of
"respected person said something therefore it must be true".

It is incorrect:
the person can be quoted out of context,
the conditions could have changed over years,
person could be mistaken.

It is used by bcash `shills due to lack of better argumetns,
chence acquisition of the @bitcoin twitter, blockexplorer.com, bitcoin.com
by them.

Truthful statement can be logically explained on own merit.
