Fallacy of undefined attack, as used by some trolls, is method of `FUD where:
1. you claim there is some attack or problem
2. you paste some smart-sounding terms
3. you refuse to say how actually the attack would work

Example: saying that `LN is vulnerable to Sybil just because Sybil
would be dangerous in routing-anonymity networks like Freenet,
but refusing to explain the attack in detail.
