Fallacy of undefined problem, as used by some trolls, is method of `FUD where:
1. you claim there is some attack or problem
2. you paste some smart-sounding terms, PDFs, YT vids of conferences (`fallacy-authority)
3. you refuse to say how actually the attack would work or apply in this instance
;

Example: saying that `LN is vulnerable to Sybil just because Sybil
would be dangerous in routing-anonymity networks like Freenet,
but refusing to explain in detail why would that
at all matter in LN
which does not have goal of IP anonymity
in its routing.

It is all just `mumbojumbo
therefore
can be ignored as trolling.
