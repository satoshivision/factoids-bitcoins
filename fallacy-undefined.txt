Fallacy of undefined problem, as used by some `shills, is method of `FUD where:
1. you claim there is some attack/problem
2. you paste some smart-sounding terms, PDFs, YT vids of conferences (`fallacy-authority `mumbojumbo)
3. you refuse to say how actually the attack would apply in this case
;

Example: saying that `LN is vulnerable to Sybil just because Sybil
would be dangerous in routing-anonymity networks like Freenet.
