Fallacy of claiming something is worse (while it is the same)
as used by some trolls,
is method of `FUD where:
1) lament problem X in solution A
2) but hide fact that same problem X exists in your solution B too
3) and anyway proceed to say that we need to switch to B to fix X
;

Example: 
`segwit-steal
