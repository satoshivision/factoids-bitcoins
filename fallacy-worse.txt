Fallacy of claiming it's worse in Bitcoin (while it is not),
as used by some trolls,
is method of `FUD where:
1. you claim that it's horrible that problem X exists in solution A
2. but you hide the fact that same problem X exists also on your solution B
(and is considered there irrevelant usually)
3. and you anyway proceed to say that we need to switch to your solution B
even though it doesn't help X
;

Example: 
`segwit-steal
saying that SegWit is insecure because we can revert past half-year of blocks
and steal from it,
while ignoring it's considered impossible to do such revert
and that it would be as terrible to do on non-SegWit as well.
