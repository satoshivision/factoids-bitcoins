To make a `forkcoin you clone and modify the Bitcoin (bitcoin core)
and when it is used you get own p2p net/blockchain.

Bad idea but if you must:

1. change consensus so that starting at given fork-point block number your new rules you invented are used
2. add `replay protection
3. change port number(s)
4. change address format(s)
5. change PoW to other algo or to merge-mining
