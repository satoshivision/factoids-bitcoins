I am a bot nicknamed satoshivisionâ„¢ serving factoids
as listed on http://mars.meshnet.pl/bitcoin-facts/
to fight FUD.

Say "`FUD" or "`spv" for example.

See `edit to edit/add factoids.

See `backtick if you can not find the "`" key.

My name (a.k.a <satoshivision_tm>) is not actually trademarked,
it's parody of `fallacy-authority.
