LN tx (transactions) are literally just Bitcoin on-chain (`L1) transatcions,
with deferred publication time.

So they have identical money supply as BTC,
they ARE Bitcoin
(are NOT other tokens nor IOU).

Also opening channel (L1->L2 tx) doesn't cause any inflation
even momentary:
before LN users accept L2 tx they will wait to see the L1 transaction,
so same 1 coin can NOT continue to be used on L1 while it is moved to L2.
