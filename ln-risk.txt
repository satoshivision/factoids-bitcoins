Lightning Network is as secure as regular Layer-1 Bitcoin transactions,

because it is based on them and you never give up ownership of your coins
(you only freeze them for defined time in a smart contract
that by defaults give your money back to you on Layer-1).

Though until officially stable version is released,
you could audit the generated transactions,
or use `LN only for not too big value.
