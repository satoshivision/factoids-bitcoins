Some `shills keep saying that Lightning Network (`LN) is not existing.

That is another `FUD, 
in reality:
as of 2017-01-12
TorGuard VPN commercial merchant is accepting real (BTC main-net) payments over Lightning.

(How ever it is beta and not recommended to be fully solid, use it for this small payments
where you have problems with `fees).
