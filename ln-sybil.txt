Some people spreading `FUD about bitcoin and `LN
are spreading lies that there is
some
"Sybil attack"
on LN.

They always refuse to define what they mean by such attack,
therefore
can be ignored as trolls.

At most they paste scientific-sounding terms
like
"avg. node distance"
but it is all just `mumbojumbo.
