Some people spreading `FUD about bitcoin and `LN
write about imaginary
"Sybil attack"
on LN.

There is no such attack.

At most they paste scientific-sounding terms
like
"avg. node distance"
but 
without any logical sense;
it is all just `mumbojumbo.

They refuse to define what they mean by such attack
in detail,
therefore
can be ignored as trolls.
