LN (Lightning Network) works like zero-cost instant cash-layer on top of the Bitcoin.
It is a layer2 solution.
It is now in development,
though first commercial tx was already done (to Bitrefil).
Join #lnd and #lightning-dev.
Install and use on testnet, report bugs, learn how to use, to make it a reality faster.
