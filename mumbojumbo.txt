Sometimes enemies of Bitcoin will spread `FUD
by saying random words that make no technical sense.

They take smart-sounding terms like
"Sybil attack"
or
"Graph distance avg."

and mix them together with no logical connection,
adding something derogative at end like
"inflation"
or
"centralized".

It is also a tactics that `faketoshi uses to
write his
"science papers"
usually.
