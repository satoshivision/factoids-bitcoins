Some could argue that `whitepaper proposed
to in future validate on large server farms.

That is not about validating validity of blockchain though, because

1) it was about mining (Satoshi called it "validating").
2) it would make it much less p2p and much more centralized.

Either way this is bad idea (see `spv) no matter who said what (`fallacy-authority)
