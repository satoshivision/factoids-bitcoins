There is a `FUD about `segwit
proposing that miners could steal all of Bitcoin SegWit
transactions.

This is a case of `fallacy-worse
because they ommit the crucial information
that executing such attack would require
as much work as to attack anyway the "regular" Bitcoin;

It would require to revert ALL BLOCKS back to 2017-08-01,
so would cost billions of USD (and growing),
and is therefore considered IMPOSSIBLE.

(In addition checkpoints can block it too).
