There is a `FUD about `segwit
lying that miners could easily steal all of Bitcoin SegWit
transactions.

This is a case of `fallacy-worse
because they ommit the crucial information
that executing such attack would require
as much work as to attack anyway the "regular" Bitcoin:

would require to revert ALL BLOCKS back to 2017-08-01
(allowing to doublespend it all),
and would cost billions of USD (and growing)
- so is therefore considered IMPOSSIBLE.
