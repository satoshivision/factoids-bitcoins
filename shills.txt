Shills are people who
spread lies on given topic
even though they know it is wrong;

For own profit (e.g. being paid,
or tricking others to invest into coin the shill owns;
see `bcash).

Some refuse to have a debate and instead paste `mumblejumbo
or commit
some logical `fallacy.

Some continue even after being proven wrong each time
[see `dymurray].
