In network based on `spv wallets all the trust hinges on:
the miners (80% owned by 2-3 people)
the SPV servers like ElectrumX (around 10 maybe 20)
perhaps big exchanges (few people).
If they are forced or choose to allow it, then all `spv users
will accept invalid blocks forever.
This is very centralized situation.
