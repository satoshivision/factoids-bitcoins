SPV (light wallets) do not check validity of blocks.

This allow miners to produce invalid blocks
in which they print money for themselves
and merchants on SPV will not realize payment is worthless.

If majority of users uses spv (see `bigblocks)
then miners can get away with it -
the last `fullnode honest users will be forced
to give up too (or be "hardforked" away)
