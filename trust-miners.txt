Some could propose to ONLY trust miners and give up on checking
blocks they produce (`spv wallets do that).

Miners already proven they will gladly exploit network
to get more money, when they let BCH drop difficulty (EDA)
over 500% more then normal level, to inflate money by 180%,
by cooperation of over 80% hashpower.

Therefore we can never trust them;
anyway that would CENTRALIZE (3-4 companies).
