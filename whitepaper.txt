Whitepaper of Bitcoin was released to describe first version of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin evolved and diverged from ideas literally writen in old whitepaper,
e.g. by adding new signature type (pay to script hash).

Some `shills keep insisting on biblical devotion to orginal wording
of Whitepaper
where ever it serves their goals.
